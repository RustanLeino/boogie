## About

Boogie is an intermediate verification language (IVL), intended as a layer on
which to build program verifiers for other languages. Several program verifiers
have been built in this way, including the
[VCC](https://github.com/microsoft/vcc) and
[HAVOC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/havoc) verifiers for C
and the verifiers for [Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny),
[Chalice](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/chalice), and
[Spec#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/spec). 
For a sample verifier for a toy language built on top of Boogie, see
[Forro](https://github.com/boogie-org/forro).
A previous version of the language was called BoogiePL. The current language
(version 2) is currently known as just Boogie, which is also the name of the
verification tool that takes Boogie programs as input.

Boogie is also the name of a tool. The tool accepts the Boogie language as
input, optionally infers some invariants in the given Boogie program, and then
generates verification conditions that are passed to an SMT solver. The default
SMT solver is [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

The Boogie research project is being developed primarily in the [RiSE
group](http://research.microsoft.com/rise) at [Microsoft
Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) in Redmond. However, people at
several other institutions make the open-source Boogie tool what it is.

## Language Reference

See [Language reference](http://boogie-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/LangRef.html).

Note: [This is Boogie2](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/krml178.pdf) details
many aspects of the Boogie IVL but is slightly out of date.

## Getting help

We have a public [mailing list](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/boogie-dev) for users of Boogie.

## Building

The preferred way to build (and run) Boogie today is using .NET Core.
Historically, Boogie can also be built using the classic .NET Framework (on
Windows) and Mono (on Linux/OSX), but this might not be supported in the future.

To run Boogie, a supported SMT solver has to be available (see below).

### .NET Core

```
$ dotnet build Source\BoogieDriver\BoogieDriver-NetCore.csproj
```

The compiled Boogie binary is `Binaries\Boogie.dll`, which can be executed with
`dotnet` or using the wrapper script `Binaries\boogie-dotnet`.

Furthermore, a NuGet package is created in `Binaries\nupkg`.

### Windows (requires Visual Studio)

1. Open ``Source\Boogie.sln`` in Visual Studio.
2. Right click the ``Boogie`` solution in the Solution Explorer and click ``Restore NuGet Packages``.
3. Click ``Build > Build Solution``.

The compiled Boogie binary is `Binaries\Boogie.exe`.

### Linux/OSX (requires Mono)

Either open ``Source\Boogie.sln`` in MonoDevelop and perform the same steps as
described for Visual Studio above, of compile on the command line as follows.

Fetch the NuGet packages that Boogie depends on:

```
$ nuget restore Source/Boogie.sln
```

Build Boogie:

```
$ msbuild Source/Boogie.sln
```

The compiled Boogie binary is `Binaries/Boogie.exe`, which can be executed with
`mono` or using the wrapper script `Binaries/boogie`.

## Backend SMT Solver

The default SMT solver for Boogie is [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).
Support for [CVC4](https://cvc4.github.io/) and
[Yices2](https://yices.csl.sri.com/) is experimental.

### Z3

The current test suite assumes version 4.8.4, but earlier and never versions may
also work.

Option 1: Copy (or symlink) a Z3 executable into `Binaries/z3.exe`.

Option 2: Call Boogie with `/z3exe:<path>`.

### CVC4 (experimental)

Call Boogie with `/proverOpt:SOLVER=CVC4 /cvc4exe:<path>`.

### Yices2 (experimental)

Call Boogie with `/proverOpt:SOLVER=Yices2 /yices2exe:<path> /useArrayTheory`.

Works for unquantified fragments, e.g. arrays + arithmetic + bitvectors. Does
not work for quantifiers, generalized arrays, datatypes.

## Testing

Boogie has two forms of tests. Driver tests and unit tests

### Driver tests

See the [Driver test documentation](Test/README.md)

### Unit tests

See the [Unit test documentation](Source/UnitTests/README.md)
